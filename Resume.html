		<h1>Introductions</h1>
		<p>
			Hello, if you haven't noticed already, my name is Nelson North III (The third). However, if you want, please refer to me by my nickname; Trey.
		</p>

		<p>
			Currently, I am attending the University of Connecticut (UConn) at the Stamford campus. I am majoring in Digital Media and Design, and I am hoping that my career will be in Video Game Design and Development.

		<h1>A little About Me</h1>
		<p>
			The reason my nickname is "trey", is because I am currently the third Nelson, alive. My father's name is Nelson, along with my grandfather's name. I was given the nickname so that we don't get confused when someone calls out our name. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Now, for something a little less serious. I am an avid comic book fan, and gamer. My favorite superhero is the futuristic cyber-punk Batman Beyond. My favorite game franchise is the beloved Pokemon Series.
